What stood out most was that he didn't just stop at the resume—he kept checking in with me, offering job search tips, and genuinely cared about how I was doing. You don't get that kind of support often. If you're serious about landing a job and want someone who actually cares about your success, I highly recommend Ajay and GTA Resume Builder. 10/10 experience!",
